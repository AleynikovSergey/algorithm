In this repository my implementation algorithms

Algorithm List:
	-find the terms of the numbers in the array
		1. Merge array sorting
		2. Binary Search for an element (x - a[i]) in an array
		3. Returns 2 indexes that give x = a[index] + a[i]
	Assymptotics algorithm is 2nlogn (merge sort + binary search for each element in array)
